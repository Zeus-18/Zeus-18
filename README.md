I'm Kushagra Bande, and I'm currently pursuing my Integrated Masters of Technology in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I believe in applying classical strategies to modern-day projects, and I'm an intermediate-level programmer in Python,and Java. Recently, I've been trying my hand at NodeJS and am excited to expand my knowledge in this area.

I've completed some basic and advanced Python projects using popular libraries like Tkinter, Pandas, and NumPy, and I'm always looking for new challenges to enhance my programming skills.

I'm thrilled to be on this journey of learning and self-discovery, and I believe that my passion for AI and ML, programming skills, and writing talent make for an excellent combination. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me and look forward to making a meaningful contribution to this world.
